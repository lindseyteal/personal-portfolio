### Design Process

My aim was to create something fun, simple and easy to read. As my surname is Teal this became the base for my design. I used this as a search term on Pintert and I created a board full of ideas, which can be found here:

These searches helped me to select various colour schemes. The Chrome colour-palette extension was really sueful for this.

Once I had chosen a number of different colour I then selected three different fonts from the Google fonts range and all all of this into Figma.

My design process started off quite slowly until I came across a great geometric pattern on Pixabay. I loved this pattern as it reminded me of the cover art of one of my favourite albums, Gotye's Making Mirrors so I decided to use this to add the fun element into my design.

I started with the main colour being Teal, but it became too over powering using it as the background. When I only used it as the text colour and kept the background grey or white, looked a bit sedated for what I was aiming for.

I then decided to add in the yellow and purple to brighten things up. The three main colours are version of the secondard colours, which woerk well together so I was confident using them together. 

I generally always work to make things event and straight,but after doing some research about what is trending in website design I desinged a broken grid style design with uneven boxes that often overlap.

Really enjoyed the design process. Quite happy with my final result. I found it to be simple, sleek and easy to read.

### Development Process

I started by placing all of my information in the approatioate tags in HTML. I included a lot of id tags in the HTML document which made my CSS a lot easier and makes it really clear which section I am styling.

The development process took a lot longer that I had anticipated. I spent quite a bit of time playing around with flex box and CSS grid, but was unable to achieve the result I was after. I made the decision to simplify my webiste design for now and I will continue to work on it as I learn more skills.

I did find that once I got on a bit of a roll with CSS I was able to achieve a lot in a short amount of time and I was really enjoying the process.

My favourite part was adding the social links into the navigation bar.


## Summary

My website is definitely still a work in progress and I would like to do a lot more work to it before I share this link to any potential employers.

In hindsite I wish I had sought help earlier from my peers and teachers wiht my flexbox issues.

I am proud of what I have achieved so far. Really happy that i was able to get something up on the web.
