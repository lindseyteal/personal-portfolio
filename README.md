### Design Process

My aim was to create something fun, simple and easy to read. As my surname is Teal this became the base colour I used this as a search term on Pintert and I created a board full of ideas, whihc can be found here:

Geometric Patterns
Vinyl Cover


Started with the main colour being Teal, but it became too over powering using it as the background. Only using it as the text colour and keep the background grey or white, looked a bit sedated for what I was aiming for. 

Always been good at things being even, but ater looking at some web design sites and seeing that random shapes were in I decided to change it. Broken grid.

Really enjoyed the design process. Quicte happy with my final result.


### Development Process

The development process took a lot longer that I had anticipated. I spent quite a bit oif time playing around with flex box and CSS grid, but was able to achieve the result I was after. In hindsite I wish I had sought help earlier from my peers and teachers. 

I made the decision to simplify my webiste design for now and I will continue to work on it as I learn more skills.

Started by placing all of my information in the approatioate tags in HTML. I included a lot of id tags in the HTML document which made my CSS a lot easier and makes it really clear which section I am styling.
